## Sprint 1: Data Wrangling and Storytelling
The data is available [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-05-12).
The objective is to look at the dataset with a creative spirit. 
1. Start by exploring the data, without any initial clear objective.
2. Raise hypotheses, answer them using the data.

Also, can you enrich the data from other sources than the ones specified in the repository? 

##### Python Libraries Used

``` Numpy ```
``` Pandas ```
``` Matplolib ```
``` Seaborn ```
``` Datetime ```

### Summary and Findings after Analysis
1. There was a lot of volcanic activity, but only few were confirmed eruptions. 
2. The Subduction zone produces the highest volcanic activity and the highest number of confirmed erupted volcanoes.
3. The number of confirmed erupted volcanoes is in an upward trend.
4. There is more voclanic activity in July and January than in other months.
5. The United States has the highest number of volcanic eruptions however, Japan has more volcanoes producing eruptions than the United States.
6. The largest subregion with erupting volcanoes is Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia. 
7. The number of active volcanoes is lower today, than it was over 100 years ago.
8. There is very little correlation between the volcanic eruptions and temperature rise
